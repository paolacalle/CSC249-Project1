# Project 1: DIY Webserver

Acknowledgments: Given that I have never used socket programming before, I googled a lot of information. To acknowledge all of the resources I used, I will link them below (I may be missing some since I deleted the file I was using to keep track of them):

I would also thank the TA, for always being available to answer my questions in regards to the project. 

## Reflection
This project helped me understand TCP connections in Python using socket programming. I learned how to create a socket, bind it to a specific address and port, and also how to send and receive HTTP packets. It was especially cool to learn how to multi-thread in python. In fact, when I tested the different threads, it was amazing to watch different requests run in parllel. Especially once I implemented my own browser, I was able to see more clearly the request and recieve relationship between a server and client. All in all, I would say Phase 1 was definitely the hardest because I was still getting used to all the terminology. That said, as the weeks went by and the things I learned in class started to click, I started to understand what exactly I was doing. I think this project was lots of fun once the scary "AHHH!! I don't know what I am doing" phase started to clear up.
